        "# Appendix: The Project is based on a device called wi-fi dongle to estimate the number of mobile device with wi-fi function.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "### In tracking mobile devices, one of the method is through a wi-fi dongle. A Wi-Fi dongle, also known as a Wi-Fi adapter or USB Wi-Fi adapter, is primarily designed to allow a computer to connect to Wi-Fi networks and access the internet wirelessly. It does this by receiving and transmitting Wi-Fi signals between the computer and nearby Wi-Fi access points.\n",
        "\n",
        "### While a Wi-Fi dongle can detect and interact with nearby Wi-Fi devices, it typically does not have the capability to directly record the number of mobile devices around it. The functionality of a Wi-Fi dongle is focused on networking and internet connectivity for the host device (e.g., a computer, laptop, or tablet) rather than monitoring or tracking nearby devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### To record the number of mobile devices around a specific location, specialized equipment and software are usually required. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1.\tWi-Fi Access Points: Wi-Fi routers and access points can log information about devices that connect to them, including the number of connected devices. However, this is limited to devices actively connecting to the specific Wi-Fi network managed by the access point.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2.\tWireless Network Monitoring Tools: Dedicated network monitoring tools can provide insights into nearby Wi-Fi networks, devices, and traffic. These tools may offer features to analyze network activity, detect devices, and monitor signal strength, but they typically require specific hardware and software configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.\tLocation-Based Services (LBS): Some systems, such as location-based services used in retail or public spaces, can track the presence of mobile devices using technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or RFID. These systems often combine hardware sensors with software platforms to monitor and analyse device presence and movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### In summary, while a Wi-Fi dongle is essential for wireless internet connectivity on a computer, it is not typically designed to record or track the number of mobile devices around it. However, with specialised software, it is possible to estimate the number of mobile devices around the perimeter.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### To monitor and track the number of mobile devices around a specific location using Wi-Fi signals, It needs specialized software tools designed for wireless network monitoring and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Wireless Network Monitoring Tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "####  1.\tKismet: Kismet is a popular open-source wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. It can detect and track Wi-Fi networks, devices, and their activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  2.\tWireshark: While primarily a packet analyser, Wireshark can be used to capture and analyse Wi-Fi traffic, including the presence and activities of nearby devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.\tNetSpot: NetSpot is a Wi-Fi analyser and survey tool that can scan and visualize Wi-Fi networks, including nearby devices and their signal strengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4.\tAcrylic Wi-Fi: Acrylic Wi-Fi is a Wi-Fi analyser and scanning tool that can detect nearby Wi-Fi networks, devices, and signal strengths. It offers features for network troubleshooting and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### These software tools vary in their features, capabilities, and compatibility with different Wi-Fi hardware. Depending on your specific requirements, such as the size of the area to monitor, the level of detail needed, and the types of devices to track. Additionally, some software may require compatible hardware or access to specific Wi-Fi infrastructure for optimal functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "## PCAP Data\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pcap (packet capture) data is a common and valuable form of collectible data in network analysis through dongle. Pcap files contain recorded network traffic, including packet headers and payloads, captured from a network interface. They are widely used by network administrators, security professionals, researchers, and analysts for various purposes, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Network Troubleshooting: Pcap data allows analysts to examine network traffic to diagnose and troubleshoot network issues such as congestion, packet loss, and latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Security Analysis: Security analysts use pcap data to investigate security incidents, detect intrusions, and analyse malicious activities such as malware infections, phishing attacks, and network reconnaissance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Protocol Analysis: Pcap data provides insights into how network protocols are used and can help in protocol debugging, performance optimization, and protocol compliance analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Forensic Analysis: Pcap data can be used in digital forensics investigations to reconstruct network communications, identify suspicious behaviour, and gather evidence for legal proceedings.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Traffic Monitoring and Analysis: Pcap data allows for the monitoring and analysis of network traffic patterns, trends, and usage statistics, which can be valuable for capacity planning, network optimization, and policy enforcement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### It is known that tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and tshark are commonly used to capture, analyse, and manipulate pcap data. Overall, pcap data serves as a fundamental source of information for understanding and analysing network behaviour and is an essential component of network analysis workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Estimation of Number of Mobile Devices Around using Pcap data\n",
        "\n",
        "#### To estimate the number of mobile devices using Wireshark with pcap data using following steps, one can leverage Wireshark's filtering and analysis capabilities,\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Capture Packets: Start Wireshark and capture packets on the network interface where mobile devices are connected.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Filter Mobile Device Traffic: Apply a display filter to focus on packets originating from or destined to mobile devices. This could include filtering by MAC address, IP address range, or specific protocols commonly used by mobile devices (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Analyse Unique Identifiers: Look for unique identifiers such as MAC addresses, IP addresses, or device fingerprints to identify individual mobile devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Track Connections: Monitor connections established by mobile devices to servers or other devices on the network. You can use Wireshark's statistics features to analyse connection statistics and identify unique device connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Aggregate Data: Aggregate the data by counting unique MAC addresses, IP addresses, or device fingerprints to estimate the number of distinct mobile devices observed in the pcap data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Consider DHCP Traffic: Analyse DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) traffic to identify IP addresses assigned to mobile devices dynamically. This can help in counting the number of active devices on the network.\n",
